Taking a look at the relationship of Health and Happiness

The World Happiness Report is a survey of the state of global happiness. The happiness scores and ranks come from The Gallup World Poll. 
The main happiness evaluation question is known as the Cantril Ladder, which asks the respondent to rank their current life on a 
scale from 0 to 10. 10 being the best possible life and 0 being the worst. The data was originally released to the UN to help people 
in various fields of study to understand what types of public policies move the needle on happiness. This data can significantly 
change our thinking on various political issues.

Happiness Rank: Rank of nation on happiness index
Happiness Score: Metric measured by asking “How would you rate your happiness on a scale of 0 to 10 where 10 is the happiest”
Standard Error: Standard Error of happiness score
Economy GDP Per Capita: Extent to which GDP affects happiness score
Family:  Extent to which Family affects happiness score
Health(Life Expectancy):  Extent to which Health affects happiness score
Freedom:  Extent to which Freedom affects happiness score
Trust (Government Corruption):  Extent to which Trust in Government affects happiness score
Generosity:  Extent to which Generosity affects happiness score
Dystopia Residual: Dystopia is an imaginary country that has the world’s least-happy people. Extent to which the Dystopia Residual affects happiness score

My main focus in undertaking this data is how health and healthcare can affect happiness. More generally, I would like to see the 
aspect of life that most contributes to global happiness. Are there policies that can contribute to higher happiness scores?
